            Mongolia[c] (/mɒŋˈɡoʊliə/ ⓘ mong-GOH-lee-ə) is a landlocked country in East Asia, bordered by Russia to the
            north and China to the south. The western extremity of Mongolia is only 23 km (14 mi) from Kazakhstan, and
            this area can resemble a quadripoint when viewed on a map. It covers an area of 1,564,116 square kilometres
            (603,909 square miles), with a population of just 3.3 million, making it the world's most sparsely populated
            sovereign state. Mongolia is the world's largest landlocked country that does not border a closed sea, and
            much of its area is covered by grassy steppe, with mountains to the north and west and the Gobi Desert to
            the south. Ulaanbaatar, the capital and largest city, is home to roughly half of the country's population.

            <h3>History</h3>
            Nomadic empires (first millennium CE) – first introduction

            The earliest introduction of Buddhism into the Mongolian steppes took place during the periods of the nomadic empires. Buddhism penetrated Mongolia from Nepal via Central Asia. Many Buddhist terms of Sanskrit origin were adopted via the Sogdian language.[citation needed]
            
            The rulers of the nomadic empires such as the Xiongnu (209 BC – 93 CE), Xianbei (93–234), Rouran Khaganate (late 4th c. – middle 6th c.) and the Göktürks (middle first mill. CE) received missionaries and built temples for them. Buddhism prevailed among aristocrats and was patronised by the monarchs of the Xianbei-led Northern Wei dynasty (386–535) and of the Khitan-led Liao dynasty (916–1125). The Khitans aristocracy regarded Buddhism as the culture of the Uyghur Khaganate that dominated the Mongolian steppes before the rise of the Liao dynasty. The monarchs of the Jurchen-led Jin dynasty (1115–1234) also regarded Buddhism as part of their culture.
            
            The oldest known Mongolian language translations of Buddhist literature were translated from the Uyghur language and contain Turkic language words like sümbür tay (Sumeru Mountain), ayaγ-wa (a dative form of ayaq, a Uyghur word meaning honor), quvaray (monk) and many proper names and titles like buyuruγ and külüg of 12th-century Turkic origin.[2]</section>

                <h3>Mongol Empire and Yuan dynasty (13th–14th century) – second introduction</h3>

                Zayiin Gegeen Monastery in Tsetserleg
                Genghis Khan (c. 1162 – 1227) and his immediate successors conquered nearly all of Asia and European Russia and sent armies as far as central Europe and Southeast Asia. The emperors of the Yuan dynasty (1271–1368) in the 13th and 14th century converted to Tibetan Buddhism.
                
                The founder of the Yuan dynasty, Kublai Khan, invited lama Drogön Chögyal Phagpa of the Sakya school of Tibetan Buddhism to spread Buddhism throughout his realm (the second introduction of Buddhism among the Mongols). Around this time, influence from the Church of the East was noted to be a major cultural factor for Mongols[3] that indirectly spread and altered Mongolian Buddhism, and therefore Chinese Buddhism.[4] However, Church of the East Christianity was a minority religion among Mongols.[5]
                
                Some Mongolian Buddhist institutions borrowed large amounts of doctrine from Nestorian Christians.[4]
                
                Other religions such as Manichaeism, Islam, and Zoroastrianism also influenced Mongolian Buddhism.[6] Catholic Church elements and even Roman Catholic believers also contributed to the syncretic practices of the time.[6]
                
                Buddhism became the de facto state religion of the Yuan dynasty. In 1269, Kublai Khan commissioned Phagpa lama to design a new writing system to unify the writing systems of the multilingual empire. The 'Phags-pa script, also known as the "Square script", was based on the Tibetan script and written vertically from top was designed to write in Mongolian, Tibetan, Chinese, Uighur and Sanskrit languages[7][8][9][10] and served as the official script of the empire.</section>
